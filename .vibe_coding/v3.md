# V3: Project Restructuring and `uv` Integration

## The Problem: Unconventional Project Structure and `uv` Usage

The project initially had a flat structure with `sync.py` in the root, and the `testing` directory contained a helper script rather than a formal test suite. Additionally, while `uv` was used, the `README.md` did not fully leverage its capabilities for running the tool without explicit installation, and the `pyproject.toml` was missing a `requires-python` declaration.

## The Solution: Standard Python Project Layout and Enhanced `uv` Integration

To improve maintainability, scalability, and align with standard Python project conventions, the following changes were implemented:

1.  **Project Restructuring**:
    *   The main synchronization logic (`sync.py`) was moved to `src/directory_sync/main.py`.
    *   The `testing/scripts/generate_test_data.py` script was moved to `tests/generate_test_data.py`.
    *   Empty `__init__.py` files were added to `src/directory_sync/` and `tests/` to properly define them as Python packages.
    *   The now-empty `testing/` directory was removed.

2.  **`pyproject.toml` for Project Metadata**:
    *   A `pyproject.toml` file was created to define project metadata, including the project name, version, and a `[project.scripts]` entry point (`directory-sync = "directory_sync.main:main"`).
    *   A `requires-python = ">=3.8"` field was added to `pyproject.toml` to explicitly declare Python version compatibility, resolving a `uv` warning.

3.  **Enhanced `uv` Integration and Documentation**:
    *   The `README.md` was updated to reflect the new project structure and provide clear instructions for setting up the virtual environment and installing the project using `uv`.
    *   New sections were added to `README.md` demonstrating how to run the `directory-sync` tool using `uv run`, which allows execution without a persistent installation.
    *   All example commands in `README.md` were updated to use `uv run`.

These changes establish a more conventional and robust project structure, improve dependency management, and streamline the development and execution workflow using `uv`.
