# V1: Performance Improvements - Parallel Execution

## The Problem: Slow Synchronization

The user observed that the `sync.py` script was performing slowly, especially when synchronizing directories with a large number of files. The initial suspicion was that the file copying method itself was inefficient.

## Analysis and Investigation

1.  **Initial Hypothesis**: We first investigated whether the script was using a suboptimal method for copying files. A review of `sync.py` showed that it was already using `shutil.copy2`, which is the recommended, high-performance function from Python's standard library that leverages efficient, low-level system calls where possible.

2.  **Identifying the Bottleneck**: With the copy mechanism confirmed as efficient, the bottleneck was identified as the **sequential execution** of file operations. The script processed every single file (copy, replace, or delete) one by one. For a large number of files, the cumulative overhead of this sequential processing led to significant delays.

## The Solution: Conditional Parallelism

The goal was to improve performance without removing the user's ability to confirm each operation individually. The user wanted to retain the `(y/n/t)` prompt but have a way to accelerate the process for trusted operations.

We implemented a solution that introduces parallelism conditionally:

-   **ThreadPoolExecutor**: We refactored the main execution loop in `sync.py` to use a `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. This creates a pool of worker threads that can perform file operations concurrently.

-   **"Trust" as a Trigger for Parallelism**: The script's behavior for the user remains the same until they select the `'t'` (trust) option for a specific action type (e.g., `copy`).

-   **Parallel Execution**: When `'t'` is selected:
    1.  The current file operation is submitted to the thread pool.
    2.  All subsequent operations of the *same type* (e.g., all remaining copies) are immediately submitted to the pool as well.
    3.  The script then waits for all of these parallel tasks to complete before moving on to the next operation type (e.g., `replace`).

This hybrid approach provides the performance benefits of parallel processing for bulk operations while preserving the safety and control of individual confirmation when needed.
