# V2: UI Improvement - Progress Bar for Bulk Operations

## The Problem: Lack of Feedback for Bulk Operations

When the user selected the "trust" (`t`) option to perform a large number of `copy`, `replace`, or `delete` operations, the script would print a simple wall of text, one line for each completed file. This made it difficult to gauge the progress of the operation, especially for thousands of files where the process could take a significant amount of time.

## The Solution: Visual Progress with `tqdm`

To provide better real-time feedback during these bulk operations, we decided to implement a terminal-based progress bar.

1.  **New Dependency**: We introduced the `tqdm` library, a popular and easy-to-use tool for creating smart progress meters in command-line applications. This was added to `requirements.txt`.

2.  **Integration with `sync.py`**: The script was modified to incorporate the progress bar:
    *   When the user selects `'t'`, the list of files for that operation type is wrapped in a `tqdm()` iterator.
    *   This automatically displays a progress bar that shows the percentage complete, an iteration count (files processed / total files), and the elapsed/remaining time.
    *   The individual print statements (e.g., "Copied 'path'") for each file operation were suppressed during bulk execution to prevent them from cluttering the terminal and interfering with the `tqdm` progress bar's UI.
    *   Error messages are now printed using `tqdm.write()`, which ensures they are displayed correctly above the progress bar without disrupting it.

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience for large synchronization tasks by replacing the wall of text with a clean, informative, and visually appealing progress bar.
