# Project: Directory Sync

## Initial Setup

We started by creating a basic Python project structure. This included:

- An empty `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.
- A `README.md` file with instructions for setting up a virtual environment, activating it, and installing dependencies.

## Core Functionality: `sync.py`

The main goal was to create a Python script named `sync.py` to synchronize two directories: a source and a destination.

### Command-Line Interface

The script was designed to be run from the command line with the following arguments:

- `--src`: The path to the source directory.
- `--dest`: The path to the destination directory.
- `--compare_mode`: The method for comparing files. It can be either `size` (default) or `checksum`.
- `--dry_run`: A flag that, if present, prevents the script from making any actual changes to the file system.

### Synchronization Logic

The script performs the following steps:

1.  **State Comparison**: It recursively scans both the source and destination directories to build a state of each. This state includes file paths and either their sizes or MD5 checksums, depending on the chosen `compare_mode`.
2.  **Change Identification**: By comparing the two states, the script identifies the necessary changes to make the destination directory a mirror of the source. The possible changes are:
    -   **Copy**: Files that exist in the source but not in the destination.
    -   **Replace**: Files that exist in both but have different sizes or checksums.
    -   **Delete**: Files that exist in the destination but not in the source.
3.  **Change Report**: The script prints a detailed report of the planned changes. We iterated on the format of this report to make it as clear as possible, settling on a `tree`-like structure that visualizes the changes within the destination directory's hierarchy.
4.  **Execution**: If the `--dry_run` flag is not used, the script proceeds to execute the changes. For each file operation, it prompts the user for confirmation (y/n/t). The 't' option allows the user to trust all subsequent operations of the same type (copy, replace, or delete) for the remainder of the run.

### Refinements and Improvements

Throughout the development process, we made several key refinements:

-   **Reporting First**: We modified the script to print the full change report before starting the execution phase. This gives the user a complete overview before any changes are made.
-   **Code Refactoring**: We removed a redundant `dry_run` parameter from internal functions, making the code cleaner and more logical.
-   **Improved Report Formatting**: We moved from a simple list of changes to a more intuitive, `tree`-like format for the change report, which better represents the directory structure.
-   **Filesystem Independence**: We confirmed that using `os.path.getsize()` for size comparison is a reliable method, even when syncing between different filesystems, as it reports the logical file size, which is consistent across filesystems.

## Testing and Documentation

To improve the project's usability and testability, we added the following:

### Synthetic Data Generation

-   We created a new script, `testing/scripts/generate_test_data.py`, to generate test data for local development.
-   This script creates two directories, `src` and `dest`, under `/tmp/test_data` with a random structure of files and subdirectories, including differences to test all synchronization cases (create, replace, delete).
-   The script accepts `--max_depth`, `--approximate_files`, and `--approximate_size_of_each_file` as command-line arguments to control the generated data's complexity.

### Documentation Updates

-   The `README.md` file was updated to include:
    -   Instructions on how to run the `sync.py` script with its various command-line arguments.
    -   A new section explaining how to use the `generate_test_data.py` script to create synthetic data and then use it for testing `sync.py`.

### Version Control

-   A `.gitignore` file was added to the project to exclude the virtual environment directory (`venv/`), Python cache files, and other common unnecessary files from version control.
